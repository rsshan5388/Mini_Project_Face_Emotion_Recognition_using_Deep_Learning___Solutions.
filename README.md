# Mini_Project_Face_Emotion_Recognition_using_Deep_Learning___Solutions.
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that detects facial emotions using grayscale images from the FER2013 dataset. The model classifies images into 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
